### Error 4: Environment File Setup
**Error Description:** Unable to access .env file - file might not exist in the repository structure yet.

**Solution:**
Need to:
1. Create the .env files in both frontend and backend directories
2. Ensure .gitignore is properly configured
3. Document environment variables in README without exposing sensitive values

**Prompt to Fix:**
```
When setting up environment files:
1. First check if .gitignore is properly configured
2. Use push_files to create/update .env.example files
3. Create actual .env files with sensitive data
4. Verify file creation with get_file_contents
5. If access errors persist, check repository permissions and file paths
```
