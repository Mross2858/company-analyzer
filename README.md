## Errors and Solutions Log
*(This section will be populated with encountered errors and their solutions)*

### Error 1: Initial README Creation
**Error Description:** Initial attempts to create README using individual file creation failed due to encoding issues.

**Solution:**
Used the `push_files` function instead of individual file creation, which handles the encoding properly.

**Prompt for Similar Issues:**
```
When encountering GitHub API file creation issues:
1. Use push_files instead of create_or_update_file for more reliable file operations
2. Ensure content is properly formatted in UTF-8
3. Use the branch-PR workflow for changes
```

### Error 2: Pull Request Creation
**Error Description:** Attempt to create pull request resulted in 'Unprocessable Entity' error.

**Possible Issues:**
1. PR might already exist
2. Branch might have no changes
3. Base and head branch might be the same
4. Missing required parameters

**Solution:**
Work directly in main branch for now while investigating PR creation issues.

**Prompt to Fix:**
```
Can you:
1. Check if a PR already exists for this branch
2. Verify the branch has commits that differ from main
3. Ensure base and head branches are different
4. Try creating the PR with minimal required parameters first
5. If still failing, try using the GitHub web interface to create the PR and analyze the difference
```

### Error 3: Component Creation
**Error Description:** Need to ensure proper setup for shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS.

**Solution:**
Make sure to:
1. Install required dependencies
2. Set up Tailwind configuration
3. Import shadcn/ui components properly

**Prompt to Fix:**
```
Before adding new components:
1. Verify shadcn/ui is properly installed
2. Check Tailwind CSS configuration
3. Test component rendering with basic elements first
4. Add more complex features incrementally
```
