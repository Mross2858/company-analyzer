## Errors and Solutions Log
*(This section will be populated with encountered errors and their solutions)*

### Error 1: Initial README Creation
**Error Description:** Initial attempts to create README using individual file creation failed due to encoding issues.

**Solution:**
Used the `push_files` function instead of individual file creation, which handles the encoding properly.

**Prompt for Similar Issues:**
```
When encountering GitHub API file creation issues:
1. Use push_files instead of create_or_update_file for more reliable file operations
2. Ensure content is properly formatted in UTF-8
3. Use the branch-PR workflow for changes
```
