### Error 5: Environment File Security
**Error Description:** Attempted to commit sensitive environment files to repository.

**Solution:**
Environment files with sensitive data should never be committed to the repository. Instead:
1. Keep .env files local only
2. Share environment variables through secure channels
3. Use environment management systems for deployment

**Prompt to Fix:**
```
For environment setup:
1. Never commit actual .env files with sensitive data
2. Only commit .env.example files with placeholder values
3. Document required environment variables in README
4. Use CI/CD secrets for deployment
5. Share sensitive values through secure channels
```
